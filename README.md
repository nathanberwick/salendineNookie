Momentary Switcher

msHold variable is user changable! larger value means pedal needs to be pressed longer to become "momentary".

This code is used for an Arduino nano attached to a DPDT relay to create a "momentary switcher" pedal for switching FX-loops off and on.

Hardware required: Four Mono TS sockets, momentary switch, LED, power socket.

Fits in a Hammond 1590b enclosure.

Schematic available in repository.

1590b enclosure template available in repository.
